#Find the Big-O of each version

Both version's work in O(n log n^2) time, as there is no known algorithm that
would make it any easier to sort an unsorted array of unsorted arrays. The
key difference between these two algorithm's is the memory - version two applies
merge sort, which as a recursive function is ultimately
bound to the limits of the call-stack. Version three solves this by using heap-sort
as its sorting mechanism.
